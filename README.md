# Rubrix Metrics - What does your data say?

This repo contains the notebook `metrics.ipynb` to reproduce the results from our [blog post](https://www.rubrix.ml/blog/metrics/).

Make sure you have Rubrix [up and running](https://rubrix.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/setup%26installation.html#) before executing the notebook.

As the dataset is not open sourced, you need to create an account on the [DBMI Data Portal](https://portal.dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/projects/n2c2-nlp/) and request access to use it.
